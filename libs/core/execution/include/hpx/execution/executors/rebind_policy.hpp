/// \brief Orthogonal customization points for rebinding an execution
///        policy's executor and executor parameters independently of one
///        another.
///
/// hpx::execution::detail::execution_policy is the CRTP base class that
/// CRTP-based built-in execution policies derive from; not every
/// built-in policy uses it (thrust_task_policy is one example that does
/// not). It exposes a single, combined rebind operation: given a new
/// Executor and a new Parameters type, it produces
/// Derived<Executor, Parameters>, where Derived is the
/// template <typename, typename> class the concrete policy is written as.
/// hpx::execution::experimental::rebind_executor_t builds on top of that
/// combined operation.
///
/// That combined operation requires every execution policy to be shaped
/// exactly as Derived<Executor, Parameters>, which is awkward for a policy
/// that needs to carry additional state, expose additional template
/// parameters, or simply is not naturally expressed as a two-parameter
/// class template. This header adds two smaller, independently
/// specializable customization points, one per axis, so a policy can
/// opt in to rebinding along either axis without being forced into that
/// shape at all. The default implementations of both customization points
/// forward to rebind_executor_t, so they share its implementation rather
/// than duplicating it. The matching construction-side customization
/// points live in create_rebound_policy.hpp; the executor-only and
/// parameters-only overloads of
/// hpx::execution::experimental::create_rebound_policy, as well as
/// on(), with(), and the scheduling property queries of
/// hpx::execution::detail::execution_policy, go through both.
